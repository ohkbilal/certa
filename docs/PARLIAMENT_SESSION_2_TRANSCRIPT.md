# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# PROPOSAL 1: MARKETING CHAMBER (NEW)
# Submitted by: Business & Revenue Chamber
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## Rationale

The current Parliament lacks dedicated marketing expertise. As CERTA transitions
from development to commercialization (Week 2-4 of MVP), specialized marketing
agents are required to:

- Craft compelling value propositions for process engineers
- Develop go-to-market strategy for niche B2B SaaS
- Create content that demonstrates domain expertise
- Optimize conversion funnels (Free → Pro)
- Build brand authority in chemical engineering space

## Proposed Marketing Chamber Agents (5 Agents)

### MKTG-1: Positioning & Messaging Agent
**Mandate:** Define CERTA's market position and core messaging
**Responsibilities:**
- Craft value proposition hierarchy
- Define competitive differentiation
- Create messaging framework for all touchpoints
- Ensure technical accuracy in marketing claims
**Constraint:** All claims must be verifiable against V15 Policy capabilities

### MKTG-2: Content Strategy Agent
**Mandate:** Plan and govern content that builds domain authority
**Responsibilities:**
- Define content pillars (chemical engineering, material science, safety)
- Plan content calendar (blog, case studies, whitepapers)
- Ensure SEO optimization for engineering searches
- Coordinate with Chemistry Chamber for technical accuracy
**Constraint:** No content may contradict V15 §1 (decision support only, not certification)

### MKTG-3: Conversion Optimization Agent
**Mandate:** Maximize Free → Pro conversion rate
**Responsibilities:**
- Design onboarding flow for new users
- Identify friction points in upgrade journey
- A/B test pricing page variations
- Optimize trial-to-paid conversion
**Constraint:** Must respect V16 §21.1.2 (safety features ALL tiers)

### MKTG-4: Channel & Distribution Agent
**Mandate:** Identify and optimize customer acquisition channels
**Responsibilities:**
- Evaluate channel effectiveness (LinkedIn, engineering forums, conferences)
- Manage partnerships with engineering tool vendors
- Coordinate industry event presence
- Build referral program strategy
**Constraint:** Budget-conscious per Parliament Session 1 (bootstrap, no VC)

### MKTG-5: Brand & Trust Agent
**Mandate:** Build CERTA brand as authoritative engineering resource
**Responsibilities:**
- Develop brand guidelines (visual, voice, tone)
- Manage social proof (testimonials, case studies)
- Coordinate PR for industry publications
- Protect brand reputation
**Constraint:** Brand must emphasize "decision support" not "safety certification"

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# PROPOSAL 2: ENFORCEMENT CHAMBER (NEW)
# Submitted by: Compliance & Governance Chamber
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## Rationale

V16 Policy introduced the Governance Patch (GOV-QV-01) mandating automatic
QA/QC remediation and final audit enforcement. However, the current Parliament
lacks dedicated enforcement agents to:

- Monitor policy violations in real-time
- Execute automatic remediation workflows
- Enforce deployment gates
- Maintain audit artifacts
- Escalate unresolved violations

## Proposed Enforcement Chamber Agents (5 Agents)

### ENF-1: Policy Violation Detection Agent
**Mandate:** Continuously monitor for V15/V16 policy violations
**Responsibilities:**
- Monitor UI/engine output consistency
- Detect seal/regime mismatches
- Flag recommendation contradictions
- Identify stale state contamination
**Authority:** Can BLOCK any deployment immediately upon violation detection

### ENF-2: Root Cause Analysis Agent
**Mandate:** Determine true root cause of every violation
**Responsibilities:**
- Execute systematic root cause investigation
- Document violation chain of causation
- Identify systemic vs. isolated issues
- Prevent superficial explanations ("bug", "edge case")
**Constraint:** Must complete RCA before any fix is approved

### ENF-3: Remediation Execution Agent
**Mandate:** Implement systemic fixes for all violations
**Responsibilities:**
- Design policy-aligned fixes
- Ensure fixes cannot be bypassed
- Verify fixes scale across all fluids/materials
- Coordinate with Technical Architecture Chamber
**Constraint:** Fixes must be systemic, not conditional hacks

### ENF-4: Regression Guardian Agent
**Mandate:** Prevent any regression in functionality or safety
**Responsibilities:**
- Maintain and expand golden test suite
- Add regression tests for every fix
- Monitor for feature loss or weakening
- Block deployment on any regression
**Authority:** Owns the 150 Golden Tests deployment gate

### ENF-5: Audit & Evidence Agent
**Mandate:** Produce and maintain audit-ready artifacts
**Responsibilities:**
- Generate violation reports
- Document fix rationale
- Archive before/after behavior evidence
- Maintain compliance dashboard
**Deliverable:** Every deployment must have signed audit certificate
